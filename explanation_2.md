# Problem 2: File Recursion

There is no need for a data structure to solve this problem. I am using an array to keep track of the
files that have been found. I am using recursion to solve this problem.

* Worse `get` time case complexity: O(n)
* Space complexity: 0(n)        for the array solution


## Required Tools
* Python3

## Usage
* clone project
* `cd {folder}` into the repo folder
* `python3 {fine_name}` the file you want to run
