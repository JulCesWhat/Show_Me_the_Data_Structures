# Problem 6: Union and Intersection

I am using a dictionary to find the union of two linked lists so that I don't have duplicate values in the
result. I am using two dictionaries to find the intersection of two linked lists because it will allow me
to find the items that are in both linked list pretty quickly.

* Worse `union` time case complexity: O(n)
* Worse `intersection` time case complexity: O(n)
* Space `union` complexity: 0(n)
* Space `intersection` complexity: 0(n)


## Required Tools
* Python3

## Usage
* clone project
* `cd {folder}` into the repo folder
* `python3 {fine_name}` the file you want to run
