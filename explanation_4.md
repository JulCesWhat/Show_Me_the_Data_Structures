# Problem 4: Active Directory

I decided to use a class that contains an array of groups and another one for users. The solution does
not require the usage of any data structure.

* Worse sentence encoding time case complexity: O(n)    where n is the amount of groups inside a group
* Space complexity: N/A                                 since I am not using any data structure to hold data


## Required Tools
* Python3

## Usage
* clone project
* `cd {folder}` into the repo folder
* `python3 {fine_name}` the file you want to run
