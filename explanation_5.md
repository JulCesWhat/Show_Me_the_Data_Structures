# Problem 5: Blockchain

I am using a linked list to solve this problem because we can keep adding blocks to our blockchain
indefinitely. I am also using a linked list so that we can keep track of the next block in the
blockchain.

* Worse `append` time case complexity: O(1)
* Worse `get_block_at_position` time case complexity: O(n)
* Space complexity: 0(n)


## Required Tools
* Python3

## Usage
* clone project
* `cd {folder}` into the repo folder
* `python3 {fine_name}` the file you want to run
